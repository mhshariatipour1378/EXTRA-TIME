The project frontend is a React application compiled with Webpack.
[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) have been used to style the components.

- `frontend/public` - The location of static files
- `frontend/src` - The location of dynamic files
- `frontend/src/components` - React components


### Backend

An Application Programming Interface, or API, defines the classes, methods, functions and variables that your application will need to call in order to carry out its desired task. In the case of PHP applications that need to communicate with databases the necessary APIs are usually exposed via PHP extensions.
